* **Dashboard Mock-Ups**   
The workflowr framework is capable of publishing dashboards created using flexdashboard. Shiny elements cannot be used via worfklowr, interactivity requires document to be hosted on ShinyIO. These dashboards are intended to very lightweight and used only for mock-ups for production dashboards or feature development.
